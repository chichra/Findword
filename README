The android application allows the user to search for the meaning, pronounciation, synonyms, antonyms and example usage of a 'word'.
Volley library is used to extract these inforamtion from 'wordnik' API.
After that , the user (if she/he wants) can add the word to his dictionary, and can fetch the info about the word 'offline'.
thus, in this way user can have a dictionary of words he/she finds important or uses frequently.

Main android modules used:
1. Volley android library.
2. SQLite Database operations
3. Wordnik Api

TODO:
